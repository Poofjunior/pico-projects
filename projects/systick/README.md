Example on how to read the systick register.

## Environment Setup
Ensure that all git submodules have been cloned locally.
(See the top-level readme for details.)

## Compiling
From this directory, create an empty directory called **build**, enter it, and invoke cmake with:
````
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
````
After this point, you can invoke the auto-generated Makefile with `make`.
